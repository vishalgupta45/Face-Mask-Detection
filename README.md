# Face-Mask-Detection
Hi all, this is my face mask detection project . 
The technologies used are python, openCV, TKinter.
The scope of my project is to detect whether a person is wearing a mark or not .
It takes stream dataset as an input and uses HAAR Cascade classifiers to check whether targeted person is wearing a mask or not.
